# BlinkCameraArchive
BlinkCameraArchive is a Python tool that can be scheduled to run and retrieve Blink Camera .mp4 files prior to their expiration using the undocumented Blink API

**NOTE**: In it's current state, the intended use is no longer functional. The Blink Team has made changes which are not compatible with the implemented method for authentication.
